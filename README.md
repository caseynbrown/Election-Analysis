## Election Audit Summary
This script was able to effectively determine the winner of the election by comparing votes between candidates as well as determine county-voter information that can be useful for future elections. 
This script can be used to evaluate candidates across multiple counties/states. We can add in additional candidates as well if there is a larger pool and can provide valuable information for the election board.
